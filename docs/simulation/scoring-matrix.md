| Navigation Clarity | 5.9 | Needs Work |
| Relevance | 6.7 | Needs Work |
| Language/Jargon | 6.9 | Needs Work |
| Device Fit | 7.1 | Needs Work |
| Return Motivation | 6.6 | Needs Work |
| Asset Accessibility | 7.1 | Needs Work (marketing tier only) |
| Output Quality | 5.7 | Rethink |

**Weakest dimension: Output Quality (5.7)** — AI-generated content doesn't match brand voice; marketing personas can't get ROAS/CRM data.
**Second weakest: Navigation Clarity (5.9)** — Too many pages, no role-based filtering, no search on Home.

| Tier | Personas | Average | Status |
|------|----------|---------|--------|
| Executive | 5 | **7.6** | Needs Work (dragged down by CFO) |
| Store | 5 | **5.5** | Rethink |
| Supply Chain | 3 | **5.6** | Rethink |
| Marketing | 5 | **6.5** | Needs Work |
| Support | 1 | **7.3** | Needs Work |
| New Starter | 1 | **8.4** | Meets Bar |

**Best served: New Starters (8.4)** — Pillar intros + Academy + Hub Assistant = excellent onboarding.
**Worst served: Store (5.5)** — Time-poor users with basic tech skills can't navigate a 33-page platform.

## Marketing Board Rubric Assessment

| Board Criterion | Required Score | Hub Score | Gap |
|----------------|:-:|:-:|---|
| Brand Health & Awareness (1-3) | 1+ | **0** | No brand tracking, Share of Voice, or sentiment data exists in The Hub |
| Campaign ROI & Attribution (1-3) | 1+ | **0** | No ROAS, CPA, A/B test, or attribution data. No ad platform integration |
| Digital & CRM Performance (1-2) | 1+ | **0** | No email metrics, loyalty active members, or LTV cohort analysis |
| B-Corp & Values Brand Integration (1-2) | 1+ | **0.5** | Greater Goodness page exists with B-Corp context but no messaging templates or ESG PR tracking |

**Marketing Board Readiness: 0.5/8 — The Hub cannot support the marketing team's board reporting requirements.**

## Personas Scoring 8+ (Ship Ready)

1. **Phil (CTO)** — 8.8 — He built it, he understands it
2. **Angus (Co-CEO)** — 8.4 — Sponsor, power user, sees strategic value
3. **Kai (Grad)** — 8.4 — Perfect onboarding tool for digital natives
4. **James (Procurement)** — 8.3 — PLU Intelligence is a genuine breakthrough
5. **Sean (Head of Ops)** — 8.0 — Operational data meets his needs

## Personas Scoring Below 5 (Critical Redesign Needed)

3. **Trevor (Store Mgr)** — 3.6 — Discovery, access, and navigation all failed
