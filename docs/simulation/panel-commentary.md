# Rubric Panel Evaluation: "First Day at The Hub"

**Harris Farm Markets — AI Centre of Excellence Platform Simulation**

7 evaluators reviewed 20 persona journeys across the platform (a Streamlit app with 33 pages: Sales, PLU Intelligence, Market Share, Prompt Engine, Academy, Way of Working, Marketing Assets, etc.)

---

## The CEO (Strategic Value)

1. "The Way of Working section pulling 100 live Monday.com initiatives is board-ready. This is the first time I can see all 5 pillars' progress in one view."
2. "We have no adoption metrics. I can't tell the board how many people are using this platform. Before we roll out further, we need basic telemetry -- unique users per week, pages visited, features used."
3. "The platform is technically impressive -- 33 pages, 383M rows -- but it's been built by the tech team for the tech team. Store managers and warehouse staff are completely left behind."

## The Designer (UX)

1. "Navigation is the #1 problem. 33 pages in a flat sidebar with strategic pillar names that non-executives don't understand. A produce manager looking for 'my sales numbers' has to decode 'Today's Business, Done Better'. Role-based navigation would fix this instantly."
2. "Mobile experience is broken for anyone in the field. The top nav row with 8 columns is illegible on a phone. Supply chain and store staff -- arguably 70% of the workforce -- primarily use phones. This needs a responsive redesign or a dedicated mobile-first entry point."
3. "The search-on-homepage gap is critical. Three personas (Trevor, Darren, Marco) would have found what they needed if Home had a prominent search bar saying 'What are you looking for?' instead of strategic pillar cards."

## The Sceptic (Resistance Patterns)

1. "The CFO (Damien) will actively resist this because the data doesn't match FloQast and there's no Excel export. Finance teams won't adopt a tool that can't reconcile with their source of truth."
2. "Trevor (small-format store manager, 15 years experience) represents an entire cohort -- experienced operators who feel this is 'another head office project'. They won't adopt unless a peer shows them value, not a top-down mandate."
3. "The marketing team will be the loudest critics. Sophie (CMO) expected ROAS and campaign data. She got an asset library. The gap between expectation and reality is dangerous -- she may become an active detractor."

## The Champion (Advocacy Potential)

1. "Kai (graduate) is your Trojan horse. He's already on the leaderboard, he's competitive, and he'll tell every other grad. Start the pilot with the graduate program -- they'll create organic advocacy."
2. "James (procurement buyer) had a genuine breakthrough with PLU Intelligence. One quote from him -- 'This replaced 3 of my weekly Excel reports' -- is worth more than any feature list. Film his testimonial."
3. "Tilly's (content creator) discovery of using Trending + Market Share for data-driven social content is the kind of unexpected innovation that justifies the entire platform. She didn't use it the way we designed it -- she invented a new workflow."

## The Operator (Practical Utility)

1. "The 2-minute test failed for all 3 personas who needed it (Marco, Darren, and arguably Trevor). If 70% of your workforce can't get value in 2 minutes on a shared terminal or phone, the platform doesn't serve the business -- it serves head office."
2. "PLU Intelligence and the Analytics Engine (basket analysis on 383M rows in 15 seconds) are genuine operational tools. These should be the hero features for the Operations rollout, not the strategic framing."
3. "Missing integrations are the biggest practical gap: no Dayforce (HR), no FloQast (finance), no TMS (transport), no Klaviyo (CRM), no Meta/Google Ads. The Hub is an island. Operational users need it to connect to their existing tools."

## The CMO (Marketing Effectiveness)

1. "Marketing Assets is a good start -- having brand guidelines and campaign creatives in one location is genuinely useful for the creative team. But it's a file server with a nice UI, not a marketing intelligence tool."
2. "The Hub scores 0.5 out of 8 on our board presentation rubric criteria. Zero ROAS data, zero email performance metrics, zero brand health tracking, minimal B-Corp integration. I cannot use this platform for board reporting."
3. "The Prompt Engine generates generic AI copy, not Harris Farm copy. Without brand voice training -- our tone of voice, our community language, our 'For The Greater Goodness' ethos baked into the prompts -- the marketing team will get faster output but worse output."

## The Transformation Lead (Adoption & Scalability)

1. "The platform is architecturally ready for scale -- 33 pages, 147 API endpoints, 56 database tables, Monday.com integration. The infrastructure is solid. The problem is purely adoption: zero real users outside the build team."
2. "Change resistance will kill this if we mandate adoption. The pilot must be opt-in with visible early wins. Start with procurement (James) and graduates (Kai) -- they had breakthrough moments. Let their success pull others in."
3. "We need 3 numbers before the board meeting: (1) number of active users per week, (2) time saved vs manual process (get James to quantify), (3) quality score trend from the Rubric. Without these, the board will see a tech project, not a business transformation."

## Points of Agreement (All 7 Evaluators)

1. Navigation needs role-based simplification -- unanimous
2. Mobile experience is inadequate for field staff -- unanimous
3. Usage analytics are the #1 missing capability for proving value -- 6/7
4. PLU Intelligence is the standout operational feature -- 5/7
5. Marketing data gap is the biggest functional blind spot -- 5/7

## Points of Disagreement

1. **Deploy now vs hold:** The Champion and CEO say "ship with fixes" -- the momentum matters. The Sceptic and CMO say "hold" -- shipping with gaps creates detractors faster than advocates.
2. **Priority audience:** The Operator says "fix for store/warehouse first -- they're 70% of staff." The Transformation Lead says "start with knowledge workers who can self-serve, then adapt for frontline."
3. **AI content quality:** The Champion says "it's a useful starting point, 60% of the work done." The CMO says "60% is worse than 0% if it goes out with our logo on it."

## Consensus Recommendations

1. **Add role-based navigation before rollout** -- Personas should see 5-8 pages relevant to their role, not 33 pages.
2. **Build a search bar on the Home page** -- "What are you looking for?" with natural language search.
3. **Add usage analytics** -- Page views, unique users, feature usage by role.
4. **Run a 2-week pilot** with procurement team (5 users) + graduate program (5 users) before any broader rollout.
5. **Do NOT position The Hub to Marketing until ROAS/CRM data exists** -- set expectations correctly.
6. **Mobile-first redesign for store/supply chain** -- separate simplified entry point or responsive layout overhaul.
