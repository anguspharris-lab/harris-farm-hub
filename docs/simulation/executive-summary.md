# The Hub — First Day Simulation: Executive Summary

*Board-ready 1-pager | Generated 2026-02-22*

---

## What We Did

Simulated 20 Harris Farm employees — from Co-CEO to warehouse floor operator — using The Hub for the first time. Each persona had realistic constraints (device, time, tech comfort, mindset). A 7-person evaluation panel scored every journey.

## Overall Hub Readiness Score: 6.4 / 10 — Ship With Fixes

## Top 3 Wins (What's Already Working)

1. **PLU Intelligence is a breakthrough** — Procurement buyer James: "This replaced 3 of my weekly Excel reports." Network-wide SKU performance across 43 stores in 15 seconds. Analytics Engine runs cross-sell analysis on 383M transactions in real-time.

2. **Strategic onboarding via pillar intro pages** — Graduate Kai understood the company's 5 strategic pillars in 2 minutes. The Academy gamification system immediately engaged him. Hub Assistant answered policy questions from the 543-article knowledge base. Best onboarding tool in the company.

3. **Monday.com initiative tracking** — 100 live initiatives across all 5 pillars visible in the Way of Working section. First time leadership can see progress across the entire strategy in one view. Board-paper ready.

## Top 3 Critical Fixes (Before Broader Rollout)

1. **Navigation overwhelm** — 33 pages with strategic pillar names confuse non-executives. Store managers and floor staff can't find their data. **Fix: Role-based navigation** — show 5-8 pages per role, add a search bar on Home.

2. **Mobile experience is broken** — 70% of the workforce (store + supply chain) primarily use phones or shared terminals. The top nav is illegible on mobile. **Fix: Responsive redesign** — hamburger menu, mobile-first entry point for field staff.

3. **No adoption metrics** — We can't prove anyone outside the build team has used The Hub. We can't show the board a single usage number. **Fix: Page-view analytics** — track unique users/week, pages/session, features used by role.

## Marketing Team Assessment: 0.5 / 10 on Board Rubric

The Hub cannot support the marketing team's board reporting requirements:
- **0/3** on Campaign ROI & Attribution (no ROAS, no CPA, no ad platform data)
- **0/2** on Digital & CRM Performance (no email rates, no loyalty data, no LTV)
- **0/3** on Brand Health & Awareness (no brand tracking, no sentiment, no SoV)
- **0.5/2** on B-Corp Integration (Greater Goodness page exists; no templates or ESG tracking)

**Do not position The Hub to the marketing team as a marketing tool until data connections exist.** Marketing Assets library is useful for brand asset centralisation. Competitive intelligence (market share data) is strong.

## Recommendation: Ship With Fixes

| Phase | Who | When | Dependency |
|-------|-----|------|------------|
| Pre-pilot | Fix P0 issues (search, nav, mobile, analytics) | Week 0 | Phil |
| Pilot A | 10 users: Procurement (5) + Graduates (5) | Week 1-2 | P0 complete |
| Pilot B | 15 users: Store managers, Ops, Finance, Analyst | Week 4-5 | Pilot A data |
| Broad | All knowledge workers (~50) | Week 7-10 | Pilot B success |
| Frontline | Store floor + warehouse (~500) | Week 11+ | Mobile redesign |

**Target for board presentation (3 weeks):** Pilot A data showing active users, time saved, and quality scores from at least 10 real users.
