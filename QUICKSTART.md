# Harris Farm Hub — Quick Start

> Everything you need to get started in 2 minutes.

---

## Start The Hub

```bash
cd /Users/angusharris/Downloads/harris-farm-hub
bash start.sh
```

## Open Your Dashboards

| Dashboard | URL | What It Shows |
|-----------|-----|---------------|
| Sales | http://localhost:8501 | Revenue, trends, product issues |
| Profitability | http://localhost:8502 | Store P&L, margins, costs |
| Transport | http://localhost:8503 | Delivery costs, route efficiency |
| Prompt Builder | http://localhost:8504 | Build custom queries |

## First 5 Things to Try

1. **Check KPIs** — top of Sales Dashboard shows revenue, profit, margin, transactions
2. **Filter by store** — use the "Stores" dropdown to see one store at a time
3. **Spot wastage** — scroll down to "Product-Level Performance" for wastage alerts
4. **Compare stores** — switch to Profitability dashboard, check the P&L table
5. **Ask a question** — scroll to bottom of any dashboard and type in plain English

## Stop The Hub

```bash
bash stop.sh
```
